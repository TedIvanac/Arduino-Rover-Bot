# Arduino-Rover-Bot
Arduin code and Processor code for Rover project. Rover has sonar, a temperature sensor, a light sensor, and gyro/accelerometer board. 
When the sonar is not scanning, data reports can be received from the other sensors on the Arduino Serial Monitor.
Processor code is necessary to project the Sonar display.

Current iteration (V1) uses two motors. future iterations will use 4 motors.
